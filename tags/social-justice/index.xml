      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hard times are coming, when we&amp;rsquo;ll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now, can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being, and even imagine real grounds for hope. We&amp;rsquo;ll need writers who can remember freedom &amp;ndash; poets, visionaries &amp;ndash; realists of a larger reality.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; From Ursula K. Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s acceptance speech, National Book Awards, 2014.</description>
