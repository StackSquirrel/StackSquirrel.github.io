About the book I initially read the first edition of this book in 2007. I was struck by how clearly the authors explained the history of copyright in Canada. They clearly demonstrate how that history informs Canadian law, and how the law informs the practice of individuals and groups across our society.</description>

About the book This small, readable book by Toronto journalist Edward Keenan did something I thought could never happen &amp;ndash; it made the election of Toronto mayor Rob Ford almost make sense!
Starting with a number &amp;ldquo;Toronto stories&amp;rdquo;, including his meeting with then-Councillor Rob Ford in 2006, Keenan uses story to describe different facets and ways of life the city of Toronto.</description>
