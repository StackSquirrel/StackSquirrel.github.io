      <description>About the book Author: Kogawa, Joy
Title: Itsuka
Publication: Toronto, Ont. : Viking, 1992. ISBN 0140169881.
DAISY audio format narrated by Sandra Scott. CELA library call number DA12414. 288 pages in the paper edition; 8 hrs., 45 mins. as a recorded book.
About the story This is the sequel to Obasan, which I reviewed earlier.
I must say that, at this point, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it holds a candle to the original but then it did not benefit from Joy Kogawa&amp;rsquo;s luminous reading.</description>

About the story This is the beautifully moving life story of an 86-year-old woman named Joyce.

      <title>Some great idea by Edward Keenan</title>

      <description>About the book Author: Keenan, Edward
Title: Some great idea: good neighbourhoods, crazy politics and the invention of Toronto.
Publication: Toronto : Coach House Books, c2013. 175 p. ISBN: 9781552452660.
About the book This small, readable book by Toronto journalist Edward Keenan did something I thought could never happen &amp;ndash; it made the election of Toronto mayor Rob Ford almost make sense!
Starting with a number &amp;ldquo;Toronto stories&amp;rdquo;, including his meeting with then-Councillor Rob Ford in 2006, Keenan uses story to describe different facets and ways of life the city of Toronto.</description>
