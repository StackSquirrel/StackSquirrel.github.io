About the story I had no idea what to expect from this book, and I must say: I&amp;rsquo;m delighted!
Set in the amusement parks of Coney Island in 1904, the main characters are the sideshow &amp;ldquo;freaks&amp;rdquo; and their friends.</description>

About the story I read Ami McKay&amp;rsquo;s first book, The birth House, many years ago and loved it. This is her second novel.
Set in New York city in 1871, the book follows the life of a young girl named Moth who lives in poverty with her mother on Christie Street, a poor area without sewers where people live in squalor as they can and die when they can no longer hold the tatters of their lives together.</description>
