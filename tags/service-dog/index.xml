      <description>It occurs to me that, since I began my sabbatical in March, I have not been posting about my recreational reading. I am still reading for fun, but much less than I did when in the normal run of things. The difference is shocking!
While off, I have been indulging in my desire to learn Python programming for data munging, and also Web stuff like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, and various volunteer web-development projects.</description>
