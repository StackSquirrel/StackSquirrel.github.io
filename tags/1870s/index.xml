About the story I read Ami McKay&amp;rsquo;s first book, The birth House, many years ago and loved it. This is her second novel.
Set in New York city in 1871, the book follows the life of a young girl named Moth who lives in poverty with her mother on Christie Street, a poor area without sewers where people live in squalor as they can and die when they can no longer hold the tatters of their lives together.</description>
