      <description>This is a very exciting development, in my opinion. I do like to read magazines from time to time, but the ones that CELA offered frankly don&amp;rsquo;t interest me (apart from L&amp;rsquo;Actualit√© and, sometimes, MacLean&amp;rsquo;s magazine). The new offerings include WIRED magazine, though, which makes me really happy.
What is a DAISY book? In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, DAISY is an accessible format that allows visually-impaired people to navigate books, create bookmarks, and generally use a book the way a sighted person would, only by listening.</description>
