      <description>I am a Canadian librarian living with vision loss. This blog helps me with RA (reader advisory) work, by reminding me of what I have read and to whom I might recommend such titles.
Many of the books I read and then write about are available through the CELA library, my local public library, or via Bookshare, in the US. They are DAISY format books, which can be read using a DAISY reader.</description>
