      <description>It occurs to me that, since I began my sabbatical in March, I have not been posting about my recreational reading. I am still reading for fun, but much less than I did when in the normal run of things. The difference is shocking!

      <description>Wherein I digress Taking a break from the usual book review, I thought I would talk about something cool that turned out to be very easy, thanks to my local library.
I was talking to my instructor at the wonderful Hadley School for the Blind, a correspondence school for blind people and those with low-vision (and their families). We were discussing clothing markers, which are attached to hangers and used to distinguish colours (blue, black, brown, etc.</description>
